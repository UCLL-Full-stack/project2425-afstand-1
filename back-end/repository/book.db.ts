        description: '**The Picture of Dorian Gray** by Oscar Wilde is a gothic masterpiece that explores themes of beauty, morality, and corruption. The story follows Dorian Gray, a handsome and vain young man, who wishes that his portrait would age in his place. His wish is mysteriously granted, allowing him to pursue a hedonistic lifestyle without visible consequences. As Dorian delves deeper into debauchery, his portrait grotesquely reflects the moral decay of his soul. Wildeâ€™s provocative tale is a haunting examination of vanity, the price of indulgence, and the duality of human nature.'
